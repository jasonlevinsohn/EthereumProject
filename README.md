#### Notes
* Smart Contracts - an account controlled by some amount of code rather than a person.
* Account created with Metamax can be linked to any network. Contract Account created by code can only be used on the network it was deployed too.
* Solidity is the strongly typed language used to write smart contracts. It spits out the byte code for deployment and the ABI - Application Binary Interface

### Setup
* Add Metamax as a Chrome Extension and create a password
* We will be using the Rinkeby Test Network for development
* 'Nonce' stands for 'nonsense', or number of transactions that have ever been made. Why? To win Bitcoin mining.
